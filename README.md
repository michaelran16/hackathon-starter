Pro Tips
--------

- When installing an NPM package, add a *--save* flag, and it will be automatically
added to `package.json` as well. For example, `npm install --save moment`.
- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you need to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might
want to scrape 3 different websites for some data and render the results in a template
after all 3 websites have been scraped.
- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.find](http://lodash.com/docs#find)
function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a
Twitter token from database: `var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });`,
where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.

FAQ
---

### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?
You need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been
added in the [pull request #40](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/40)
as part of the CSRF protection.

```
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)
```

**Note:** It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can
specify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.

**Note 2:** To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the
CSRF middleware to see if `req.originalUrl` matches your desired pattern.

### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?
That's a custom error message defined in `app.js` to indicate that there was a
problem connecting to MongoDB:

```js
mongoose.connection.on('error', () => {
  console.error('MongoDB Connection Error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.');
});
```
You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js`. You can
download MongoDB [here](http://mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager.
<img src="http://dc942d419843af05523b-ff74ae13537a01be6cfec5927837dcfe.r14.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/windows-8-50x50.jpg" height="17">
Windows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

**Tip:** If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use
[mLab](https://mlab.com/) or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/) instead
of downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update database credentials
in `.env` file.

### I get an error when I deploy my app, why?
Chances are you haven't changed the *Database URI* in `.env`. If `MONGODB` is
set to `localhost`, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is
running. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB
running on `localhost`. You need to create an account with [mLab](https://mongolab.com/)
or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/), then create a free tier database.
See [Deployment](#deployment) for more information on how to setup an account
and a new database step-by-step with mLab.

### Why Pug (Jade) instead of Handlebars?
When I first started this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find `extends` and `block` to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.

### Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?
For the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,
such as passing `app` context to each controller as outlined in this
[blog](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/),
I find such style to be confusing for beginners.
It took me a long time to grasp the concept of `exports` and `module.exports`,
let alone having a global `app` reference in other files.
That to me is a backward thinking.
The `app.js` is the "heart of the app", it should be the one referencing
models, routes, controllers, etc.
When working solo on small projects I actually prefer to have everything inside `app.js` as is the case with [this]((https://github.com/sahat/ember-sass-express-starter/blob/master/app.js))
REST API server.


### Why is there no Mozilla Persona as a sign-in option?
If you would like to use **Persona** authentication strategy, use the
[pull request #64](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/64) as a
reference guide. I have explained my reasons why it could not be merged in
[issue #63](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/issues/63#issuecomment-34898290).

### How do I switch SendGrid for another email delivery service, like Mailgun or SparkPost?
Inside the `nodemailer.createTransport` method arguments, simply change the service from `'Sendgrid'` to some other email service. Also, be sure to update both username and password below that. See the [list of all supported services](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer-wellknown#supported-services) by Nodemailer.

How It Works (mini guides)
--------------------------

This section is intended for giving you a detailed explanation about
how a particular functionality works. Maybe you are just curious about
how it works, or maybe you are lost and confused while reading the code,
I hope it provides some guidance to you.

### Custom HTML and CSS Design 101

[HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/) has many beautiful templates that you can download for free.

When you download the ZIP file, it will come with *index.html*, *images*, *css* and *js* folders. So, how do you
integrate it with Hackathon Starter? Hackathon Starter uses Bootstrap CSS framework, but these templates do not.
Trying to use both CSS files at the same time will likely result in undesired effects.

**Note:** Using the custom templates approach, you should understand that you cannot reuse any of the views I have created: layout, home page, api browser, login, signup, account management, contact. Those views were built using Bootstrap grid and styles. You will have to manually update the grid using a different syntax provided in the template. **Having said that, you can mix and match if you want to do so: Use Bootstrap for main app interface, and a custom template for a landing page.**

Let's start from the beginning. For this example I will use [Escape Velocity](http://html5up.net/escape-velocity/) template:
![Alt](http://html5up.net/uploads/images/escape-velocity.jpg)

**Note:** For the sake of simplicity I will only consider `index.html`, and skip `left-sidebar.html`,
`no-sidebar.html`, `right-sidebar.html`.

Move all JavaScript files from `html5up-escape-velocity/js` to `public/js`. Then move all CSS files from `html5up-escape-velocity/css` to `public/css`. And finally, move all images from `html5up-escape-velocity/images` to `public/images`. You could move it to the existing **img** folder, but that would require manually changing every `img` reference. Grab the contents of `index.html` and paste it into [HTML To Pug](https://html-to-pug.com/).

**Note:** Do not forget to update all the CSS and JS paths accordingly.

Create a new file `escape-velocity.pug` and paste the Pug markup in `views` folder.
Whenever you see the code `res.render('account/login')` - that means it will search for `views/account/login.pug` file.

Let's see how it looks. Create a new controller **escapeVelocity** inside `controllers/home.js`:

```js
exports.escapeVelocity = (req, res) => {
  res.render('escape-velocity', {
    title: 'Landing Page'
  });
};
```

And then create a route in `app.js`. I placed it right after the index controller:
```js
app.get('/escape-velocity', homeController.escapeVelocity);
```

Restart the server (if you are not using **nodemon**), then you should see the new template at [http://localhost:8080/escape-velocity](http://localhost:8080/escape-velocity).

I will stop right here, but if you would like to use this template as more than just a single page, take a look at how these Pug templates work: `layout.pug` - base template, `index.pug` - home page, `partials/header.pug` - Bootstrap navbar, `partials/footer.pug` - sticky footer. You will have to manually break it apart into smaller pieces. Figure out which part of the template you want to keep the same on all pages - that's your new `layout.pug`.
Then, each page that changes, be it `index.pug`, `about.pug`, `contact.pug`
will be embedded in your new `layout.pug` via `block content`. Use existing templates as a reference.

This is a rather lengthy process, and templates you get from elsewhere,
might have yet another grid system. That's why I chose *Bootstrap* for the Hackathon Starter.
 Many people are already familiar with *Bootstrap*, plus it's easy to get started with it if you have never used *Bootstrap*.
 You can also buy many beautifully designed *Bootstrap* themes at [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/), and use them as a drop-in replacement for Hackathon Starter. However, if you would like to go with a completely custom HTML/CSS design, this should help you to get started!

### How do flash messages work in this project?
Flash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access
it on next request and only next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would
display an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different
page and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once.
This project uses *express-flash* module for flash messages. And that
module is built on top of *connect-flash*, which is what I used in
this project initially. With *express-flash* you don't have to
explicitly send a flash message to every view inside `res.render()`.
All flash messages are available in your views via `messages` object by default,
thanks to *express-flash*.

Flash messages have a two-step process. You use `req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' }`
to create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:
```pug
if messages.errors
  .alert.alert-danger.fade.in
    for error in messages.errors
      div= error.msg
```
In the first step, `'errors'` is the name of a flash message, which should match the
name of the property on `messages` object in your views. You place alert messages
inside `if message.errors` because you don't want to show them flash messages are actually present.
The reason why you pass an error like `{ msg: 'Error messages goes here' }` instead
of just a string - `'Error messages goes here'`, is for the sake of consistency.
To clarify that, *express-validator* module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input,
returns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a `msg` property with a message
why an error has occurred. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:

```js
[
  { param: "name", msg: "Name is required", value: "<received input>" },
  { param: "email", msg: "A valid email is required", value: "<received input>" }
]
```

To keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages
as `{ msg: 'My flash message' }` instead of a string. Otherwise you will just see an alert box
without an error message. That is because, in **partials/flash.pug** template it will try to output
`error.msg` (i.e. `"My flash message".msg`), in other words it will try to call a `msg` method on a *String* object,
which will return *undefined*. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies
to "info" and "success" flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as:

**Data Usage Controller (Example)**
```
req.flash('warning', { msg: 'You have exceeded 90% of your data usage' });
```

**User Account Page (Example)**
```pug
if messages.warning
  .alert.alert-warning.fade.in
    for warning in messages.warning
      div= warning.msg
```

`partials/flash.pug` is a partial template that contains how flash messages
are formatted. Previously, flash
messages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages
(contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it is uses a *DRY* approach.

The flash messages partial template is *included* in the `layout.pug`, along with footer and navigation.
```pug
body
    include partials/header

    .container
      include partials/flash
      block content

    include partials/footer
```

If you have any further questions about flash messages,
please feel free to open an issue and I will update this mini-guide accordingly,
or send a pull request if you  would like to include something that I missed.

### How do I create a new page?
A more correct way to be to say "How do I create a new route". The main file `app.js` contains all the routes.
Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see 3 or more arguments
to routes. In cases like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments
are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from
continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.

```js
app.get('/account', passportConfig.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);
```

It always goes from left to right. A user visits `/account` page. Then `isAuthenticated` middleware
checks if you are authenticated:

```js
exports.isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
};
```

If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the
next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on `GET` requests or redirects on `POST` requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to *Account Management* page, otherwise you will be redirected to *Login* page.

```js
exports.getAccount = (req, res) => {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
```

Express.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, but for the most part you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.
If you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.

Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building
a page that lists all books from database.

**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.
```js
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);
```

---

**Note:** As of Express 4.x you can define you routes like so:

```js
app.route('/books')
  .get(bookController.getBooks)
  .post(bookController.createBooks)
  .put(bookController.updateBooks)
  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)
```

And here is how a route would look if it required an *authentication* and an *authorization* middleware:

```js
app.route('/api/twitter')
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthenticated)
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthorized)
  .get(apiController.getTwitter)
  .post(apiController.postTwitter)
```

Use whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I really think that chaining HTTP verbs on
`app.route` is very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand I can no longer see all my routes at a glance
when you have one route per line.

**Step 2.** Create a new schema and a model `Book.js` inside the *models* directory.
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});

const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = Book;
```

**Step 3.** Create a new controller file called `book.js` inside the *controllers* directory.
```js
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */
const Book = require('../models/Book.js');

exports.getBooks = (req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
```

**Step 4.** Import that controller in `app.js`.
```js
const bookController = require('./controllers/book');
```

**Step 5.** Create `books.pug` template.
```pug
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
```

That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:

```js
app.get('/books',(req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
```

Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little difficult to navigate the file.
I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could
work with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have 4 developers
working on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.
If you are the only developer then it's fine. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes
difficult to maintain everything in a single file.

That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.
Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,
sending emails via [Nodemailer](http://nodemailer.com/), form validation using [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) library,
parsing websites using [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), and etc.

### How do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?
[Dan Stroot](https://github.com/dstroot) submitted an excellent [pull request](https://github.com/dstroot/hackathon-starter/commit/0a632def1ce8da446709d92812423d337c977d75) that adds a real-time dashboard with socket.io.
And as  much as I'd like to add it to the project, I think it violates one of the main
principles of the Hackathon Starter:
> When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.
> I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of
> hackathon web apps, **without being too specific**.

When I need to use socket.io, I **really** need it, but most of the time - I don't. But more
importantly, websockets support is still experimental on most hosting providers. As of October 2013,
Heroku supports websockets, but not until you opt-in by running this command:

```js
heroku labs:enable websockets -a myapp
```

And what if you are deploying to OpenShift? They do support websockets, but it is currently in a
preview state. So, for OpenShift you would need to change the socket.io connect URI to the following:

```js
const socket = io.connect('http://yoursite-namespace.rhcloud.com:8000');
```

Wait, why is it on port 8000? Who knows, and if I didn't run across this [blog post](http://velin-georgiev-blog.appspot.com/blog/set-up-nodejs-express-socketio-application-using-websockets-on-openshift-by-red-hat/)
I wouldn't even know I had to use port 8000.

I am really glad that Heroku and OpenShift at least
have a websockets support, because many other PaaS providers still do not support it.
Due to the aforementioned issues with websockets, I cannot include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. *For now...*
If you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading.

First you need to install socket.io:
```js
npm install socket.io --save
```

Replace `const app = express();` with the following code:

```js
const app = express();
const server = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
```

I like to have the following code organization in `app.js` (from top to bottom): module dependencies,
import controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes,
start the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things.

Add the following code at the end of `app.js`:

```js
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.emit('greet', { hello: 'Hey there browser!' });
  socket.on('respond', (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Socket disconnected');
  });
});
```

One last thing left to change:
```js
app.listen(app.get('port'), () => {
```
to
```js
server.listen(app.get('port'), () => {
```

At this point we are done with the back-end.

You now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Pug templates or have all your client-side
JavaScript in a separate file - in `main.js`. I will admit, when I first started out with Node.js and JavaScript in general,
I placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express
right then and there. It's the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I
almost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore.

But it's also understandable if you want take the easier road.
Most of the time you don't even care about performance during hackathons, you just
want to [*"get shit done"*](https://www.startupvitamins.com/media/products/13/aaron_levie_poster_black.jpg) before the time runs out.
Well, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day,
it's **what** you build that matters, not **how** you build it.

If you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in `layout.pug` -
your main template file, add this to `head` block.

```pug
script(src='/socket.io/socket.io.js')
script.
    let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
    socket.on('greet', function (data) {
      console.log(data);
      socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hey there, server!' });
    });
```

**Note:** Notice the path of the `socket.io.js`, you don't actually
have to have `socket.io.js` file anywhere in your project; it will be generated
automatically at runtime.

If you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline
script code into `main.js`, inside the `$(document).ready()` function:

```js
$(document).ready(function() {

  // Place JavaScript code here...
  let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
  socket.on('greet', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hello to you too, Mr.Server!' });
  });

});
```

And we are done!
Cheatsheets
-----------

### <img src="https://frontendmasters.com/assets/es6-logo.png" height="34" align="top"> ES6 Cheatsheet

#### Declarations

Declares a read-only named constant.

```js
const name = 'yourName';
```

Declares a block scope local variable.
```js
let index = 0;
```

#### Template Strings

Using the **\`${}\`** syntax, strings can embed expressions.

```js
const name = 'Oggy';
const age = 3;

console.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);
```

#### Modules

To import functions, objects or primitives exported from an external module. These are the most common types of importing.

```js
const name = require('module-name');
```

```js
const { foo, bar } = require('module-name');
```

To export functions, objects or primitives from a given file or module.

```js
module.exports = { myFunction };
```

```js
module.exports.name = 'yourName';
```

```js
module.exports = myFunctionOrClass;
```

#### Spread Operator

The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.

```js
myFunction(...iterableObject);
```
```jsx
<ChildComponent {...this.props} />
```

#### Promises

A Promise is used in asynchronous computations to represent an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.

```js
var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { });
```

The `catch()` method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only.

```js
p.catch(function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
```

The `then()` method returns a Promise. It takes 2 arguments: callback for the success & failure cases.

```js
p.then(function(value) { /* handle fulfillment */ }, function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
```

The `Promise.all(iterable)` method returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.

```js
Promise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(function(values) { console.log(values) });
```

#### Arrow Functions

Arrow function expression. Shorter syntax & lexically binds the `this` value. Arrow functions are anonymous.

```js
singleParam => { statements }
```
```js
() => { statements }
```
```js
(param1, param2) => expression
```
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = arr.map(x => x * x);
```

#### Classes

The class declaration creates a new class using prototype-based inheritance.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, gender) {
    this.name   = name;
    this.age    = age;
    this.gender = gender;
  }

  incrementAge() {
    this.age++;
  }
}
```

### <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mmww2.png" height="34" align="top"> JavaScript Date Cheatsheet

#### Unix Timestamp (seconds)

```js
Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
```

```MomentJS
moment().unix();
```

#### Add 30 minutes to a Date object

```js
var now = new Date();
now.setMinutes(now.getMinutes() + 30);
```

```MomentJS
moment().add(30, 'minutes');
```

#### Date Formatting

```js
// DD-MM-YYYY
var now = new Date();

var DD = now.getDate();
var MM = now.getMonth() + 1;
var YYYY = now.getFullYear();

if (DD < 10) {
  DD = '0' + DD;
} 

if (MM < 10) {
  MM = '0' + MM;
}

console.log(MM + '-' + DD + '-' + YYYY); // 03-30-2016
```
```MomentJS
console.log(moment(new Date(), 'MM-DD-YYYY'));
```

```js
// hh:mm (12 hour time with am/pm)
var now = new Date();
var hours = now.getHours();
var minutes = now.getMinutes();
var amPm = hours >= 12 ? 'pm' : 'am';

hours = hours % 12;
hours = hours ? hours : 12;
minutes = minutes < 10 ? '0' + minutes : minutes;

console.log(hours + ':' + minutes + ' ' + amPm); // 1:43 am
```

```MomentJS
console.log(moment(new Date(), 'hh:mm A'));
```

#### Next week Date object

```js
var today = new Date();
var nextWeek = new Date(today.getTime() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

```MomentJS
moment().add(7, 'days');
```

#### Yesterday Date object

```js
var today = new Date();
var yesterday = date.setDate(date.getDate() - 1);
```

```MomentJS
moment().add(-1, 'days');
```

### Mongoose Cheatsheet

#### Find all users:
```js
User.find((err, users) => {
  console.log(users);
});
```

#### Find a user by email:
```js
let userEmail = 'example@gmail.com';
User.findOne({ email: userEmail }, (err, user) => {
  console.log(user);
});
```

#### Find 5 most recent user accounts:
```js
User
  .find()
  .sort({ _id: -1 })
  .limit(5)
  .exec((err, users) => {
    console.log(users);
  });
```

#### Get total count of a field from all documents:
Let's suppose that each user has a `votes` field and you would like to count
the total number of votes in your database across all users. One very
inefficient way would be to loop through each document and manually accumulate
the count. Or you could use [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/) instead:

```js
User.aggregate({ $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: '$votes' } } }, (err, votesCount)  => {
  console.log(votesCount.total);
});
```
:top: <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Docker
----------

You will need docker and docker-compose installed to build the application. 

- [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

- [Common problems setting up docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/faqs/troubleshoot/)

After installing docker, start the application with the following commands : 

```
# To build the project for the first time or when you add dependencies
docker-compose build web  

# To start the application (or to restart after making changes to the source code)
docker-compose up web

```

To view the app, find your docker ip address + port 8080 ( this will typically be http://localhost:8080/ ).  To use a port other than 8080, you would need to modify the port in app.js, Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.


Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with
a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top
picks. From my experience, **Heroku** is the easiest to get started with, it will
automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, zero-downtime
deployments and custom domain support on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **mLab** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Heroku_logo.png" width="200">

- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

<img src="https://mlab.com/company/img/branding/mLab-logo-onlight.svg" width="200">

- Open [mlab.com](https://mlab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- Click to the recently created database
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `.env` instead of `mongodb://localhost:27017/test`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/DATABASE_NAME'`

**Note:** As an alternative to mLab, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).

<img src="http://www.opencloudconf.com/images/openshift_logo.png" width="200">
**NOTE** *These instructions might be out of date due to changes in OpenShift. Heroku is currently a good free alternative.  If you the new process, please feel free to help us update this page*

- First, install this Ruby gem: `sudo gem install rhc` :gem:
- Run `rhc login` and enter your OpenShift credentials
- From your app directory run `rhc app create MyApp nodejs-0.10`
 - **Note:** *MyApp* is the name of your app (no spaces)
- Once that is done, you will be provided with **URL**, **SSH** and **Git Remote** links
- Visit provided **URL** and you should see the *Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift* page
- Copy and and paste **Git Remote** into `git remote add openshift YOUR_GIT_REMOTE`
- Before you push your app, you need to do a few modifications to your code

Add these two lines to `app.js`, just place them anywhere before `app.listen()`:
```js
var IP_ADDRESS = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || '127.0.0.1';
var PORT = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;
```

Then change `app.listen()` to:
```js
app.listen(PORT, IP_ADDRESS,() => {
  console.log(`Express server listening on port ${PORT} in ${app.settings.env} mode`);
});
```
Add this to `package.json`, after *name* and *version*. This is necessary because, by default, OpenShift looks for `server.js` file. And by specifying `supervisor app.js` it will automatically restart the server when node.js process crashes.

```js
"main": "app.js",
"scripts": {
  "start": "supervisor app.js"
},
```

- Finally, you can now push your code to OpenShift by running `git push -f openshift master`
 - **Note:** The first time you run this command, you have to pass `-f` (force) flag because OpenShift creates a dummy server with the welcome page when you create a new Node.js app. Passing `-f` flag will override everything with your *Hackathon Starter* project repository. **Do not** run `git pull` as it will create unnecessary merge conflicts.
- And you are done!

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Windows_Azure_logo.png" width="200">
**NOTE** *Beyound the initial 12 month trial of Azure, the platform does not seem to offer a free tier for hosting NodeJS apps.  If you are looking for a free tier service to host your app, Heroku might be a better choice at this point*

- Login to [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/)
- Click the **+ NEW** button on the bottom left of the portal
- Click **COMPUTE**, then **WEB APP**, then **QUICK CREATE**
- Enter a name for **URL** and select the datacenter **REGION** for your web site
- Click on **CREATE WEB APP** button
- Once the web site status changes to *Running*, click on the name of the web site to access the Dashboard
- At the bottom right of the Quickstart page, select **Set up a deployment from source control**
- Select **Local Git repository** from the list, and then click the arrow
- To enable Git publishing, Azure will ask you to create a user name and password
- Once the Git repository is ready, you will be presented with a **GIT URL**
- Inside your *Hackathon Starter* directory, run `git remote add azure [Azure Git URL]`
- To push your changes simply run `git push azure master`
 - **Note:** *You will be prompted for the password you created earlier*
- On **Deployments** tab of your Windows Azure Web App, you will see the deployment history

# IBM Bluemix Cloud Platform
**NOTE** *At this point it appears that Bluemix's free tier to host NodeJS apps is limited to 30 days.  If you are looking for a free tier service to host your app, Heroku might be a better choice at this point*

1. Create a Bluemix Account

    [Sign up](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=%2Fdashboard%2Fapps) for Bluemix, or use an existing account.  

1. Download and install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) to push your applications to Bluemix.

1. Create a `manifest.yml` file in the root of your application.
  ```
  applications:
  - name:      <your-app-name>
    host:      <your-app-host>
    memory:    128M
    services:
    - myMongo-db-name
  ```

  The host you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<host>.mybluemix.net`.  
  The service name 'myMongo-db-name' is a declaration of your MongoDB service.  If you are using other services like Watson for example, then you would declare them the same way.

1. Connect and login to Bluemix via the Cloud-foundry CLI
  ```
  $ cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  ```

1. Create a [MongoDB service](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/MongoDB/index.html#MongoDB)
  ```
  $ cf create-service mongodb 100 [your-service-name]
  ```
  **Note:** this is a free and experiment verion of MongoDB instance.  
  Use the MongoDB by Compose instance for production applications:
  ```
  $ cf create-service compose-for-mongodb Standard [your-service-name]'
  ```


1. Push the application

    ```
    $ cf push
    ```
    ```
    $ cf env <your-app-name >
    (To view the *environment variables* created for your application)

    ```

**Done**, now go to the staging domain(`<host>.mybluemix.net`.) and see your app running.
